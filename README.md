Rental Kata
======

A third-step kata (see Factory Kata and GlobalID Kata) for practicing:

  - Working on projects in an IDE with Maven
  - Using factories to deal with dependencies
  - Identifying Integration Tests
  - Dealing with specification driven development in the absence of a complete spec
  - Using Mocking to tightly control the world around your runnable specs
